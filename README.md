# Express Handlebars Challenge ðŸ’» ðŸ’»

## Aim of the challenge

The aim of this challenge is to practice handlebars built in helper methods to display information.

## Introduction by the mentor

Please talk over the `src` folder structure. Have a look, for example, at `src/routes/index.js` and see how we are sending a full list of users to be rendered.

## Let's start the challenge :rocket:

Your task is to edit one file (`src/views/home.hbs`) to display the users data in various ways. Some of these helpers will be useful: http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html

Also, for some challenges you will need to edit the contents of the `views/helpers` folder to create JavaScript functions that you can later use in `src/views/home.hbs`.
